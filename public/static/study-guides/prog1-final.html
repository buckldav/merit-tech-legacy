          <h3>Intro to Software Engineering</h3>
          <p>
            Before we make software, we should know what types of software are out there and the different
            implications of each. Click <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iJ2McipnNlWcEpQS9BR7RCkARD59hN294HyV0Fig8mQ">here</a>
            for a worksheet to help you out.
          </p>
          <h3>What is an IDE?</h3>
          <p>
            An IDE is an integrated development environment. It's software that allows one to code efficiently,
            usually including tools like code syntax highlighting, an integrated terminal, and workspaces to help
            you organize your files. The IDE we are using in this class is Visual Studio Code and we are starting
            by coding in Python. Once you feel comfortable with all of the information on this page, you can move
            on to working with a game engine (like Unity) to create your games for the game class and React Native
            development for the mobile class.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you'd like to get your computer set up for coding in Python in Visual Studio Code, here's a <a

          <h3>What are the basic skills I'll need to know to program effectively?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Algorithms: How to solve the problem</h4>
              <p>
                An algorithm is a step by step solution to a problem. Good programmers can take a large problem
                and break it down into smaller steps.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Commenting and Documentation</h4>
              <p>
                Good programmers can communicate their logic and ideas well. To help yourself in organizing
                your code and to help future readers of your code understand what is going on, it's important
                to leave comments, which in python are lines starting with a <kbd>#</kbd>. An example of good commented
                code, where each idea is explained in a
                comment, can be seen below with a tic-tac-toe game.
              </p>

                  frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
              <p>
                For bigger programs, it is useful to leave documentation, usually longer explanations of what
                code does and how it is organized presented as text, flowcharts, and other sorts of outlines.

              <h4>Debugging: Dealing with errors</h4>
              <p>
                Inevitably, there will be errors in your code. There are three types of errors in programming:
                syntax, runtime, and logic errors. As you become more experienced, the more apt you will be to
                deal with the errors that arise.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Syntax Errors<br>
                  The equivalent of spelling and grammar errors in programming.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Runtime Errors<br>
                  Errors that occur once the program is already running. Typically set off by a variable or
                  input that the program is not equipped to handle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Logic Errors<br>
                  Your program runs fine, but it does something that you don't want. Perhaps you wanted two
                  numbers to multiply together but you told the program to add them.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>The Terminal</h4>
              <p>
                Terminal commands you should know (these work across Windows, Mac, and Linux)<a class="ref"

              <pre><code>
  cd - "Change Directory" - allows you to change what the active directory is (the folder the terminal is using)

  Goes backward to a folder.

        <div class="col-xl-12">
          <h1>Style</h1>
          <p>
            Like written languages such as English, there are rules and conventions in programming languages to
            follow. These principles will make your code organized and readable.
          </p>
          <h3>Variables and Naming Conventions</h3>
          <p>
            When naming variables and constants, the most important thing is to BE CONSISTENT IN YOUR FORMATTING.
            If you use underscores in your names, use that naming convention throughout your entire program.
            Constants are variables in that they are like a box that holds data, but the data DOES NOT CHANGE.
            Constants should always be capitalized to distinguish them from variables.
          </p>
          <pre><code> 
  num = 5     # Assigning the value 5 to the variable "num"
  camelCase   # Variable names cannot have spaces, so camelCase is a way to allow for multiple words in a variable name
  anotherExampleOfCamelCase
  under_score # If you don't like camelCase, use underscores but BE CONSISTENT IN YOUR NAMING.
  CONSTANT    # Always do ALL CAPS for constants.
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Finally, make sure your variable names are descriptive. If you have a financial application with
            variables keeping track of dollars and cents, then name the variables <kbd>dollars</kbd> and <kbd>cents</kbd>
            respectively.

          <h1>Types and Operators</h1>
          <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
          <p>
            There are several different types of data that variables can store. Data types that are built in to
            python and are standard across most programming languages are called primitive data types. In python,
            these include:
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  integer = 0
  float = 0.0
  string = "words and letters"
  boolean = True or False
          </code></pre>
          <p>
            Integers are non-decimal numbers. Floats are decimal numbers. Strings are enclosed in quotes and can
            contain any number of letters, numbers, and characters. Finally, booleans are used for logical
            expressions and are either True (1) or False (0).
          </p>
          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p>
            Operators are symbols that carry out arithmetic or logical computation.<a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/operators"></a>

            <h1>Conditionals</h1>
            <h3>If, Elif, and Else</h3>
            <p>
                With if, elif, and else, you can make decisions in your code. An if statement works like the below code
                demostrates.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
  if condition == True:
    print("Do this piece of code")
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The decision process is easily visualized with a flowchart. Here's an example of of flowchart with one
                if statement. The test expression is a boolean expression (also known as the condition) and either
                evaluates to <kbd>True</kbd> or <kbd>False</kbd>.
            </p>

            <h1>Functions</h1>
            <p>
                A function is a section of a program that performs a specific task.<a class="ref" href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/function.html"></a>
                There are a few vocabulary words associated with functions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Defining a function</h4>
                    This is when you create the function. In python, this is done by using the <kbd>def</kbd> keyword.<br>
                    <pre><code class="python">
  def myFunction(): # This line is defining the function "myFunction"
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Scope</h4>
                    This is what is within a function and outside a functions. We will talk about two levels of scope
                    this semester, "local" and "global".<a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/global-local-nonlocal-variables"
                        class="ref"></a><br>
                    <strong>Local</strong> is code only accessible inside the control structure (e.g. if/else) or
                    function.<br>
                    <strong>Global</strong> is code accessible inside and outside the control structure or function.<br>

                    <h4>Example 1: Local variables with functions</h4>
                    <pre><code class="python">
  def myFunction():
    print("This code is local to myFunction.")
    print("This code is too, because it is indented at the same level as the above line.")
    print("Same with this one.")
    localVar = "Local"; # Scope of variable = local - only accessible within myFunction

  print("This code is not within myFunction because it is not indented on the same level like the above code.")
  print(localVar) # This does not work because localVar was declared within myFunction and is not accessible globally

            <h1>Loops</h1>
            <p>
              Loops are ways to repeat code a certain number of times. There are several kinds of loops. The ones
              that you need to know are <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops
              (both pretest and posttest).
            </p>
            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <p>
              For loops are great for two cases:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                When you need a loop to run a certain number of times.
                <iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="https://repl.it/@buckldav/for1?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
              </li>
              <li>
                When you are parsing through a collection of items like an array or list.
                <iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="https://repl.it/@buckldav/for2?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>While Loops</h3>
            <p>While loops behave similarly to conditionals (if statements) that they only execute when the condition is true.</p>
            <pre><code>
  condition = False
  while condition:
    print("This code will never execute because the condition was false.")
            </code></pre>
            <p>When the condition is true, if statements only execute once. Loops, on the other hand, execute UNTIL the condition is false again.</p>
            <iframe width="100%" height="500px" src="https://repl.it/@buckldav/if-vs-while?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>
            <h4>When to use while loops</h4>
            <p>
              Whenever a for loop won't work for you. Cases can include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    When you don't know how many times the loop will run. Rather, you want code to execute until a
                    certain condition is false.
                    <pre><code>
  from random import randint
  shouldContinue = True

  while shouldContinue == True:
    print("running")
    rand = randint(1, 10)
    if rand > 5:
      shouldContinue = True
    else:
      shouldContinue = False
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    When a loop just runs forever (until the program terminates). This is typical in game programming.
                    <pre><code class="python">
  while True:
    print("Move the character")
    print("Check for collisions")
    # etc.
                    </code></pre>
                </li>
